"""Public job-board APIs, for the pay ranges employers are legally made to publish.

Colorado, California, New York, Washington and Illinois require a salary range
on covered postings. Most other markets -- India, Singapore, much of the EU --
require nothing, so the same role at the same company is posted with a range in
Denver and without one in Bengaluru.

These are documented, public, JSON APIs intended to be read by machines. That
matters: everything here is a supported integration, not scraping, and it does
not break when a marketing site is redesigned.
