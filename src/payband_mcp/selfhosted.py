"""Employers who run their own careers site rather than a job board.

Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever, SmartRecruiters and Workday cover an enormous
number of employers, and then stop dead at the largest ones. Google, Meta,
Amazon and Apple all self-host, and #13 has been open since the first week
because of it.

There is no shared shape here -- each of these is one company's endpoint,
named explicitly rather than guessed from a slug, and each will break on its
own schedule. They are kept apart from `ats.py` so that when one does break
it cannot take the board adapters down with it.

What was probed and rejected, so nobody repeats it:

* **amazon.jobs** serves clean JSON (`/en/search.json`) and no pay whatsoever
  -- not in the list, not in `description`, not in the per-job `.json`. Amazon
  renders its Washington and California ranges into the HTML page only.
* **Netflix**, and Eightfold-hosted boards generally, return `job_description`
  over a documented API with no range in it.
* **Apple** (`jobs.apple.com/api`) answers 401 to an anonymous request.
* **Meta** and **Microsoft** did not answer a plain GET at all.

Each of those would need HTML scraping, which is a different kind of
dependency from a JSON API and belongs behind a clearly separate door.
